# passwords
a simple python program to generate passwords at random using while loops. The password is generated from a series of numbers, alphabets and special characters
i first use lists where i store my numbers( 0 - 9) and my alphabets( a - z )
 then some few special characters
 the first code could only generate a sinle password unless you change the iteration , but on the second code i implemented pythons random() built in function to select characters at random from the three.
 i then applied an iteration of 4 in the while loop so that at maximum we can only have a password with a maximum of 11 characters
 when you run the code repeatedly you get different passwords which have been selected at random from the total of 43 characters i had stored in my variables.
 Have fun and builf on it
 I would suggest building the code so that one can input his or her name and from that it can produce a personalised password
